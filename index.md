### Welcome!
I am a Policy Fellow working on European economic policy at the [Jacques Delors Centre Berlin](https://www.delorscentre.eu). 

Previously, I obtained my PhD in International Relations and Political Economy from the [University of Zurich](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch) and was as a visiting fellow at the [Weatherhead Center for Internationa Affairs](https://wcfia.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. I hold degrees in International Political Economy from the [London School of Economics](http://www.lse.ac.uk) and in Political Science and Economics from the [Free University of Berlin](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html).

My research lies at the intersection between International and Comparative Political Economy. It primarily focuses on the causes and consequences of regional economic imbalances and structural change and has been published in outlets such as *Oxford University Press*, *Journal of Politics* and the *Review of International Organizations*. My dissertation was awarded with the [SNIS Award](https://snis.ch/awards/the-politics-of-too-much-essays-on-the-emergence-and-persistence-of-current-account-surpluses/) for the best PhD thesis in international studies. In my policy work, I focus economic inequality as well as EU industrial and regional policy in Europe. 

On this website you can find information about my [research](/research),  my [CV](/cv) and the courses I  [teach](/teaching).
