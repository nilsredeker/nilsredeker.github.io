**The Politics of Stashing Wealth - The Demise of Labor Power and the Global Rise of Corporate Saving**  (under review) [ [ PDF ]]({{ site.url }}/assets/Redeker_Savings_Glut.pdf)

This paper investigates the political roots of the global rise of corporate savings. In recent years, firms throughout advanced economies have started to accumulate enormous savings. Instead of using their revenues to reinvest or raise wages, many firms now stash their profits on financial markets, contributing to sluggish growth, financial fragilities and rising inequality. I argue that political institutions that determine the balance-of-power between firms and employees play an important role in shaping this trend. The stronger unions are, the more they pressure firms into using revenues for wage raises and investment. The more their influence erodes, the stronger the rise of savings.  Using panel data from 25 OECD countries as well as a regression discontinuity design leveraging the German law on co-determination, I find robust and causal evidence supporting this claim. These results have implications for our broader understanding about how political institutions affect financial imbalances and economic inequality.

**We'd Rather Pay Than Change - The Politics of German Non-Adjustment in the Eurocrisis** (with Stefanie Walter)  [PDF]

Germany’s large current account surplus has been widely criticized, especially against the backdrop of the Eurozone crisis where the burden of adjustment was borne almost entirely by the crisis countries. We argue that Germany’s resistance to reduce its massive current account surplus through an expansionary policy at home is rooted in distributive struggles about the design of possible adjustment policies. In contrast, interstate financing  is much less controversial, turning it into a politically more expedient choice. Using evidence from original survey data from 􏰻􏱥􏱦 German economic interest groups, qualitative interviews with interest group representatives and policymakers in Germany, and data from public opinion surveys, we show that while there is general support for internal adjustment among German interest groups, they disagree heavily about which specific policies should be imple-mented to achieve this goal. Together with a broad public and elite-based consensus to avoid a break-up of the Eurozone, this polarization turns financing into the politically most a􏱧ractive strategy.

**The Politics of Bad Options - Why the Eurozone's Problems are so hard to resolve** (Chapters 6 & 7 in a joint Book Projekt with Stefanie Walter, Ari Ray and Raphael Reinke) (under review) [ [ PDF ]]({{ site.url }}/assets/Redeker_BadOptions.pdf)


The Eurozone crisis quickly developed into one of the most serious economic and political crises in the history of the EU. After almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts to resolve the fundamental structural and institutional issues that underlie the Eurozone’s problems, a resolution of the crisis remains elusive. How can we understand the difficulties to resolve the Eurozone crisis? And how can we understand the unusual approach to crisis resolution pursued by European governments? 
Our book sets out to explain the unusual European crisis experience by examining how the structural characteristics of a diverse set of Eurozone economies have affected the interests of important societal and political actors, and how these interests, in turn, have shaped Eurozone crisis management.
